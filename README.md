## Key Features

1. **Better Text Processing**: Includes proper tokenization, lowercasing, and punctuation removal
2. **TF-IDF Weighting**: Uses Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency scoring instead of simple word counts
3. **Cosine Similarity**: More robust similarity calculation method
4. **Type Safety**: Added type hints and proper error handling
5. **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly command-line interface
6. **Statistics**: Provides insights about the indexed documents

## How It Works

1. **Indexing**: Documents are processed into word frequency dictionaries (concordances)
2. **TF-IDF Calculation**: Each term gets weighted based on its frequency in the document and rarity across all documents
3. **Vector Comparison**: Query and documents are compared using cosine similarity
4. **Ranking**: Results are sorted by similarity score

## Improvements Over Original

- **Better scaling**: TF-IDF helps with the bias toward smaller documents
- **Cleaner code**: Modern Python practices with classes and type hints
- **More robust**: Better error handling and input validation
- **Enhanced preprocessing**: Proper text cleaning and tokenization
- **Statistics tracking**: Document frequency tracking for better IDF calculation

## Usage

Run the script and it will:
1. Build an index from the sample documents
2. Display statistics about the indexed content
3. Allow interactive searching with ranked results

The search engine handles queries like:
- Single terms: "captcha", "mysql"
- Multiple terms: "mysql backup", "git workflow"
- Returns relevance scores and document previews

This implementation addresses the main limitations mentioned in the original while maintaining the core vector space concept. It's suitable for small to medium document collections and could be extended with features like caching, boolean operators, or more sophisticated ranking algorithms.
